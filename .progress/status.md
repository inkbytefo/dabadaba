Phase 2 "Fully Functional" Definition:

**Core Messaging Features:**
- **Read Receipts:**
    - Functionality: Sender should be able to see when a recipient has read their message.
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - Read receipts are displayed in the chat window for sent messages.
        - Read receipts are updated in real-time when the recipient reads the message.
        - Read receipts should be visually distinct (e.g., double ticks, different color).
        - Read receipts should not be sent for messages sent by the user themselves.

**Rich Text & Media:**
- **Media Uploads:**
    - Functionality: Users should be able to upload images and videos in chats.
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - Upload button/icon is present in the chat input area.
        - Users can select images and videos from their device.
        - Uploaded media is displayed in the chat window.
        - Media files are stored in Firebase Cloud Storage.
        - Upload functionality should handle different file sizes and types (within reasonable limits).
        - Error handling for failed uploads.
- **Preview Generation:**
    - Functionality: Display previews for uploaded media (images and videos) and links.
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - Image previews are displayed for uploaded images.
        - Video previews (thumbnails) are displayed for uploaded videos.
        - Link previews are generated for URLs in messages (title, description, image).
        - Previews should be visually appealing and informative.
        - Preview generation should be performant and not block the UI.
- **Progress Tracking:**
    - Functionality: Display upload progress for media files.
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - Progress bar or indicator is displayed during media upload.
        - Progress indicator accurately reflects the upload progress.
        - Progress indicator provides visual feedback to the user during upload.
        - Progress tracking should be smooth and responsive.

**Overall Phase 2 Completion Criteria:**
- All functionalities listed above are implemented and meet the acceptance criteria.
- No critical bugs or issues in the implemented features.
- Basic UI/UX for the implemented features is in place and functional.
- Code is reasonably clean and maintainable.
- Status in `status.md` is updated to reflect completion of Phase 2 tasks.
