# Hooks Documentation

This document provides details about the custom React hooks located in the `src/hooks` directory. These hooks encapsulate reusable logic and provide a way to abstract complex functionalities within the application.

## Custom Hooks

- **`use-mobile.tsx`**: This hook is likely used to detect whether the application is running on a mobile device. It probably returns a boolean value indicating the device type, allowing components to adapt their behavior based on the platform.
- **`use-toast.ts`**: This hook is likely a custom hook built on top of the `sonner` library's `useToast` hook. It might provide a simplified or extended interface for displaying toast notifications throughout the application, possibly with pre-configured defaults or utility functions.

This document will be expanded with more details about each hook's functionality, parameters, and return values in the following sections.
